# COVID-19 - Authorized-Entry-using-Face-Mask-Detection

The system is designed to detect the faces and to determine whether the person wears a face mask or not. Using the above data, we can decide whether the concerned person can be allowed inside public places such as the market, or a hospital.

## Why Did We Build This?

"Prevention is better than cure" is one of the effective measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 and to protect mankind. Many researchers and doctors are working on medication and vaccination for corona.

To avoid getting infected or spreading it, It is essential to wear a face mask while going out from home especially to public places such as markets or hospitals.

## Requirements

### Hardware

* NVIDIA Jetson Nano
* Raspberry Pi Camera v2 or USB Camera
* Relay breakout board
* LED x 2
* Buzzer

### Software

*   NVIDIA DLI Image
*   OpenCV

## Block Diagram
The Block Diagram of this circuit is given below.

To make these connections, I've used separate connectors for power, and relay output.


### Working of the Project ðŸ”­
To test the real-time scenario, we deployed it on one of the rooms to test how possibly it could be used and the results were pretty affirmative.
